## Connect Your Computer to the Sound System
 To utilize computer audio with the speakers in Mackey Hall, follow these steps to connect your device to the sound system:

 1. Determine the appropriate method of connection:
   - Option 1: Using HDMI
     - *If you are using HDMI for Video as well, this is the only option available*
     - Identify the HDMI port on your computer.
     - Connect one end of the HDMI cable to the HDMI port of your computer.
     - Locate one of the HDMI input ports in Mackey Hall.
     - Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to the HDMI input port in Mackey Hall.
   - Option 2: Using a 3.5mm audio cable
    - *If you are using VGA for Video as well, this is the only option available*
     - Locate the audio output jack on your computer.
     - Connect one end of the 3.5mm audio cable to the audio output jack of your computer.
     - Identify one of the two audio input jacks in Mackey Hall.
     - Connect the other end of the 3.5mm audio cable to the chosen audio input jack in Mackey Hall.
  2. It's important to note that you do not have to use the projector for audio playback. The sound system can be directly connected to your computer using the methods described above. If you only want audio, just don't turn on the projector or TV.

  3. If you require further assistance with the input connections, please refer to the detailed article titled [Input Methods](../video/inputs.md "Input Methods").
 
## Adjusting Computer Volume Level
 To ensure optimal audio output, follow these steps to adjust the volume level on your computer:

 1. Set the volume on your computer to approximately 10, which corresponds to around 10% of the total volume. This initial setting allows you to check the audio levels and make further adjustments if necessary.

 2. To fine-tune the computer volume levels, you will use the iPad and the Master Fader application. For instructions on connecting the iPad to the sound system, please refer to the page titled [Connecting iPad to Sound System](ipad_sound_system.md "Connecting iPad to Sound System").

## Adjusting Volume Levels with Master Fader
 When using the Master Fader, you will encounter two different slider options depending on the configuration. Please follow the instructions below:

 1. Combined Sliders
 If the computer sliders are combined into a single slider, follow these steps:

     1. Locate the combined slider in the Master Fader interface.
     1. Use the slider to adjust the volume level according to your preference.

 2. Separate Sliders
 If the computer sliders  are separate, follow these steps:
 
     1. Identify the two separate sliders in the Master Fader interface.
     2. Adjust the individual sliders to set the desired volume level.

## Muting / Unmuting
 To mute or unmute the audio, follow these steps:

 1. Locate the mute button at the top of the sliders in the Master Fader interface.
 2. Click the mute button to toggle between muting and unmuting the audio.

 When the audio is muted, the mute button will appear orange. When the audio is unmuted, the mute button will appear white.

 Note that the number of mute buttons you need to toggle depends on whether the computer audio sliders are combined or separate.

 - If the sliders are combined, there will be one mute button to control both sliders.
 - If the sliders are separate, there will be two mute buttons, one for each slider.
