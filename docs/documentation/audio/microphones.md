### Pulpit Microphone
  The pulpit microphone is designed to plug into the pulpit. There is a cable in the top corner that it plugs into, and then that cable plugs into one of the two ports on the wall under the projector screen. This microphone usually resides in the sound system rack drawer.

## Changing Audio Levels
  Move the slider to the level that you want it at. It's best to have some kind of noise in the microphone as you adjust them and start lower on the slider dial when adjusting.

## Muting / Unmuting
  To mute/unmute, click the mute button at the top of the sliders. Orange is muted, white is unmuted.
