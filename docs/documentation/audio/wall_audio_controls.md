## Adjust Channel Levels

2. If a channel shows `Muted` in red, that channel is muted and no audio will pass.
3. Press `Muted` once to unmute the channel.
4. Use `+1%`, `-1%`, or the slider to set the channel level.
5. Use the `Speakers` card on the right (`Master Output`) for overall room output level.
