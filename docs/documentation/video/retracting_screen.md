This guide explains how to retract the projector screen in Mackey Hall.

The projector screen control switch is on the south wall, to the right of the windows.

## Retract the Screen
1. Press the upper half of the screen control switch fully in.
2. The switch is a maintained toggle, so it will stay in the selected position.
3. Wait while the screen retracts.
4. The screen will stop automatically at its fully retracted position.
5. Toggle the switch back to the neutral (center) position after the screen is fully retracted.
