## Note Regarding Wall Controls (Updated October 2024)
 There is a touch screen on the wall that replaces the old wall controls above the church PC. This is the best way to turn the projector or TV on. Below you will see two screens are called out. A second one located under the projector is planned. As of October 2024, the one above the church PC is the only screen installed.

1. Go to one of the two touch screens located in Mackey.
